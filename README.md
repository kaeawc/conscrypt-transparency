# Conscrypt Certificate Transparency

Conscrypt is a library created and maintained by Google for securely encrypting and decrypting data.

Certificate Transparency is a concept created by Google to allow clients to dynamically verify certificates as they are seen by the client.

Unfortunately on Android there isn't a good stable example of how to do all of this, so I'm creating one.
